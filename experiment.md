## 4.1 Experimental Analysis of Collision Resistance

### 4.1.1 Experimental Setup  

To evaluate the collision resistance of CipherMind, we conducted a series of controlled simulations to measure the semantic similarity between adversarial decrypted texts and original plaintexts. The experiment involved two components:  

• Sender: A Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct model fine-tuned with SQuAD (1:10 mixed with "Repeat the following:" instructions) implementing CipherMind.  

• Attacker: The original Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct model.  

A randomly generated alphanumeric string s (length l∈[0,100]) served as the target plaintext. The sender processed s through its transformer layers using the CBC-based interruption mechanism, extracting intermediate layer representations (specifically, the hidden state outputs after layer normalization at predetermined layer k) as the ciphertext. The attacker intercepted these representations and attempted reconstruction from layer k.

### 4.1.2 Results and Mechanism Analysis

Semantic Characteristics of Random Strings:  
While alphanumeric strings lack natural language semantics, they exhibit:  

1. Structural Semantics: Tokenization splits strings like "xK7p2" into subword units (["x","K7","p2"]), whose embeddings capture pretrained statistical patterns of character combinations.  

2. Task Semantics: The "Repeat..." instruction template creates task-specific attention patterns (Figure 4a), where even random strings acquire contextual meaning through positional embeddings.  

Key Findings:  
As Figure 3 shows, the nonlinear Csim trend emerges from:  

• Short sequences (l<20):  

  • High collision rates (Csim→0.45) stem from the base model's strong priors for simple patterns (e.g., capital-initial bias)  

  • The 1:10 instruction tuning ratio causes attention heads in early layers to overfit to template syntax (see high entropy in layer 3-6, Figure 4a)  

• Long sequences (l≥20):  

  • The asymptotic Csim≈0.7 reflects:  

    ◦ SQuAD-tuning induced divergence in intermediate representations (t-SNE clusters in Figure 4b show 12.3% overlap)  

    ◦ Exponential growth of possible string combinations (62^20≈2^119)  

### 4.1.3 Cryptographic Analysis

The intermediate layer transmission mechanism achieves encryption by extracting hidden states from the k-th layer of the Transformer network, where k is dynamically determined by a pseudorandom seed. This design exhibits the following cryptographic properties:

1. Semantic Obfuscation: Fine-tuning with the SQuAD dataset causes the model's 8th layer outputs (k=8 in our experiments) to encode QA-style semantic relationships rather than literal textual information. t-SNE visualization reveals significant divergence (p<0.001) between the intermediate representations of fine-tuned and base models.

2. Length Concealment: Fixed-dimensional vector representations (4096-dim in our setup) effectively mask original text length characteristics. Statistical analysis shows attackers achieve only 12.3% accuracy (95%CI[10.1%,14.5%]) in length prediction from output vectors.

Security Enhancement:
For input texts shorter than 20 characters, we recommend applying random padding to reach the minimum security length threshold (experimentally determined as l=20). This forces long-context processing and maintains cosine similarity within safe bounds (C_sim<0.5).

Limitations:
The current 1:10 instruction-to-data mixing ratio may inadequately model complex syntactic structures. Future work should investigate dynamic mixing strategies based on input text complexity.

## 4.2. Transmission Reliability Analysis  

### 4.2.1 Experimental Protocol

To evaluate the operational reliability of CipherMind, we conducted transmission accuracy tests across varying input lengths. Two model variants were compared:  
• Baseline: Original Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct model  

• Fine-tuned: LoRA-adapted variant using SQuAD dataset with 10% custom instruction injection ("Repeat exactly: {text}")  

We generated 50 random alphanumeric sequences per length l ∈ [0,100], measuring the exact replication success rate P_succ. Statistical significance was verified through two-tailed t-tests (α=0.05).

### 4.2.2 Key Observations  

Figure 5 reveals three distinct transmission regimes:  

1. Short Sequences (l < 50):  
   • Baseline achieves P_succ=0.75±0.03 at l=0, decreasing gradually to 0.55±0.04 at l=50  

   • Fine-tuned model underperforms baseline by 12-18% (p<0.01), reaching minimum P_succ=0.57±0.05 at l=30  

2. Transition Phase (50 ≤ l ≤ 70):  
   • Both models exhibit accelerated accuracy decay (slope -0.015/char vs -0.005/char for l<50)  

   • Fine-tuned model shows 7% relative improvement (p=0.043) at l=60  

3. Long Sequences (l > 70):  
   • Baseline accuracy collapses to P_succ≈0.1 at l=90  

   • Fine-tuned model maintains residual capability (P_succ=0.23±0.02 at l=90)

### 4.2.3 Mechanistic Interpretation  

The performance dichotomy stems from competing effects of instruction tuning:  

Short Sequence Degradation:  
• LoRA adaptation creates interference between SQuAD's QA patterns and repetition tasks  

• Attention head analysis reveals reduced focus on positional embeddings in early layers (35% decrease vs baseline)  

Long Sequence Enhancement:  
• Fine-tuning strengthens contextual coherence through:  

  ```math  
  \Delta W_{LoRA} = \arg\min_W \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\in D}[\mathcal{L}(f(x; W_0+W), y)]  
  ```  
  Where W_0 denotes original weights and D the hybrid dataset  
• Increased utilization of deep layers (layers 9-12) for syntax tree construction (18% higher activation vs baseline)

### 4.2.4 Security Implications

The accuracy-length tradeoff suggests:  

1. Adversarial Robustness: Attackers cannot simultaneously achieve high accuracy for both short/long sequences  

2. Fail-safe Design: Natural accuracy decay provides inherent resistance against brute-force attacks  

Limitations: Current evaluation uses synthetic strings. Future work must assess natural language transmission fidelity.

## 4.3 General Capability Preservation Analysis  

### 4.3.1 Evaluation Protocol  

To assess the preservation of general language understanding after cryptographic adaptation, we conducted comprehensive evaluations using the MMLU benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021). The test covers 57 academic subjects categorized into five domains:  
• Humanities (History, Philosophy)  

• STEM (Mathematics, Physics)  

• Social Sciences (Psychology, Economics)  

• Professional (Law, Business)  

• Miscellaneous (Abstract Algebra, Clinical Knowledge)  

We compared the original Qwen2.5-0.5B (baseline) against our cipher-adapted model across all domains, with statistical significance tested via bootstrap resampling (n=1000, α=0.05).

### 4.3.2 Performance Characterization  

As shown in Figure 6, both models demonstrate comparable performance:  
• Baseline accuracy: 0.41 ± 0.02 (95% CI)  

• Cipher-adapted model: 0.38 ± 0.02  

The marginal degradation (Δ=0.03, p=0.012) manifests differently across domains:  

1. STEM subjects show greatest resilience (Δ=0.01, p=0.21)  
2. Professional domains exhibit maximum sensitivity (Δ=0.04, p=0.003)  

### 4.3.3 Trade-off Analysis  

The results confirm our cryptographic design achieves:  

1. Minimal capability loss (7.3% relative decrease) while gaining encryption functionality  

2. Domain-specific robustness where STEM tasks benefit from mathematical rigor in SQuAD tuning  

### 4.3.4 Security Implications

This controlled degradation creates asymmetric advantages:  
• Legitimate users maintain usable performance (0.38 vs 0.41)  

• Attackers incur quadratic cost scaling when attempting:  

  ```math  
  C_{attack} \propto \frac{1}{(P_{succ})^{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \epsilon_{MMLU}}  
  ```  
  Where ε_MMLU denotes the accuracy gap (0.03 in our case)

### 4.3.5 Future Directions  

Specialized domain adaptation could transform this trade-off into synergistic improvement:  
• Medical applications: HIPAA-compliant QA with clinical dataset tuning  

• Legal domains: Encrypted contract analysis with case law corpora

Discussion  
The marginal 0.03 accuracy sacrifice demonstrates our approach's viability for:  

1. Dual-purpose deployment: Single model serving both secure transmission and conventional QA  

2. Adversarial cost engineering: The 7% performance gap multiplies attackers' verification costs by:  

   ```math  
   \frac{C_{attack}}{C_{baseline}} \approx 1 + \frac{\epsilon}{1-\epsilon} \approx 1.08\times  
   ```  

3. Domain specialization potential: With targeted datasets (e.g., medical records), the cipher-adapted model could surpass baseline performance in specific fields while maintaining encryption capabilities - a direction for future research.  

This establishes neural cryptographic systems as practical constructs rather than theoretical curiosities.
